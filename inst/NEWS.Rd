\section{Version 0.0.2 (2018-04-20)}{
  \subsection{Fixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Fixed plots downloading in triplicate
      \item DESCRIPTION file points to correct GitHub repository location
    }
  }
  \subsection{Updates}{
    \itemize{
      \item Added min.cells option for creating Seurat object
      \item A cell annotation file can be uploaded. See documentation for more info on annotation file format
      \item Once cell annotation file is loaded, names field will be updated to show grouping categories
      \item Added a selectInput to change what identity the cells are grouped by
      \item Users can select cells from interactive plots to create custom clusters, as well as reset to original clusters if needed
      \item tsne perplexity and iterations can be set by user
      \item tsne plot is now generated by automatically choosing statistically significant PCs
      \item Downloading variable gene plot also provides a .txt file with a list of the variable genes found
      \item PC heatmap and Viz plot are on one page, and downloading them also provides a table of genes that make up each PC
      \item 3D plots added for pca and tsne
      \item Point transparency can be changed with the slider input
      \item DEG violin plot is based on a drop-down menu
      \item Tables for DEG list and PC genes improved with the DT package

      \item Updated UI to hide PCA plot area until PCA was done
      \item Added FindClusters functionality to PCA tab
      \item PCA and tSNE co-ordinates will be saved to .txt files together with the PDF plots
      \item Cluster IDs also saved to .txt file when PCA plot is saved
    }
